## Binary Search Tree Traversal: inorder, preorder, post order for BST

- What is Binary Search Tree?

  - Definition:

    - A binary search tree is a binary tree made up of nodes. Each nodes has a key signifying its value.
    - The value of the nodes on the left subtree are smaller than the value of the root node.
    - The value of the nodes on the right subtree are larger than the valure of the root node.
    - The root node is the parent node of both subtrees.

  - Root:
    - The topmost node in the tree
  - Parent:
    - A node with a child or children
  - Leaf:
    - A node without a child

- What is a BST used For?

  - Binary search trees help us speed up our binary search as we are able to find items faster.
  - Add and delete items in a tree.
  - represent data in a ranked order.

- What is Tree Traversal?
  - visiting and outputting the value of each node in a paricular order.
  - Methods
    - Inorder:
      - left subtree to the root then to the right subtree
      - Left => Root => Right
    - Preorder:
      - root to the left subtree then to the right subtree
      - Root => Left => Right
    - Post order:
      - left subtree to the right subtree then to the root
      - Left => Right => Root
